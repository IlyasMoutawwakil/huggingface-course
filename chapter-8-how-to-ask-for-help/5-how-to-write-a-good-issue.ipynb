    "When you encounter something that doesn’t seem right with one of the Hugging Face libraries, you should definitely let us know so we can fix it (the same goes for any open source library, for that matter). If you are not completely certain whether the bug lies in your own code or one of our libraries, the first place to check is the [forums](https://discuss.huggingface.co). The community will help you figure this out, and the Hugging Face team also closely watches the discussions there.\n",

    "It’s very important to isolate the piece of code that produces the bug, as no one in the Hugging Face team is a magician (yet), and they can’t fix what they can’t see. A minimal reproducible example should, as the name indicates, be reproducible. This means that it should not rely on any external files or data you may have. Try to replace the data you are using with some dummy values that look like your real ones and still produce the same error.\n",

While this requires a bit more work on your side, you will almost be guaranteed to get help and a fix if you provide a nice, short bug reproducer.\n",

    "If you feel comfortable enough, go inspect the source code where your bug happens. You might find a solution to your problem (in which case you can even suggest a pull request to fix it), but more generally, this can help the maintainers better understand the source when they read your report."
