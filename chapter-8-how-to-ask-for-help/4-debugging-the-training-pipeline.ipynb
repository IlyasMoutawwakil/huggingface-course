But when you launch the command model.fit(), something horrible happens: you get an error 😱! Or worse, everything seems to be fine and the training runs without error, but the resulting model is crappy. In this section, we will show you what you can do to debug these kinds of issues."

Or it could be something wrong in the model code, or your loss function or optimizer.

How would all our logits become nan? nan means “not a number.” nan values often occur when you perform a forbidden operation, such as division by zero. But one thing that’s very important to know about nan in machine learning is that this value tends to propagate. If you multiply a number by nan, the output is also nan. And if you get a nan anywhere in your output, your loss, or your gradient, then it will rapidly spread throughout your whole model — because when that nan value is propagated back through your network, you’ll get nan gradients, and when weight updates are computed with those gradients, you’ll get nan weights, and those weights will compute even more nan outputs! Soon enough the whole network will just be one big block of nans. Once that happens, it’s pretty hard to see where the problem started. How can we isolate where nan first crept in?\n",

Don’t be fooled, though; there are always hyperparameters, and if you can’t see them, it just means that you don’t know what they’re set to. In particular, remember a critical thing about Keras: if you set a loss, optimizer, or activation function with a string, all of its arguments will be set to their default values. This means that even though using strings for this is very convenient, you should be very careful when doing so, as it can easily hide critical things from you. (Anyone trying the optional challenge above should take careful note of this fact.)\n",

In general, we recommend trying learning rates between 1e-5 and 1e-4 for your models; that’s somewhere between 10X and 100X smaller than the value we’re actually using here. That sounds like it might be a major problem, so let’s try reducing it. To do that, we need to import the actual optimizer object.

    "The telltale sign of running out of memory is an error like “OOM when allocating tensor” — OOM is short for “out of memory.” This is a very common hazard when dealing with large language models. If you encounter this, a good strategy is to halve your batch size and try again. Bear in mind, though, that some models are very large. For example, the full-size GPT-2 has 1.5B parameters, which means you’ll need 6 GB of memory just to store the model, and another 6 GB for its gradients! Training the full GPT-2 model will usually require over 20 GB of VRAM no matter what batch size you use, which only a few GPUs have. More lightweight models like distilbert-base-cased are much easier to run, and train much more quickly too.\n",

    "### Hungry Hungry TensorFlow 🦛\n",
    "One particular quirk of TensorFlow that you should be aware of is that it allocates all of your GPU memory to itself as soon as you load a model or do any training, and then it divides up that memory as required. This is different from the behavior of other frameworks, like PyTorch, which allocate memory as required with CUDA rather than doing it internally. One advantage of the TensorFlow approach is that it can often give useful errors when you run out of memory, and it can recover from that state without crashing the whole CUDA kernel. But there’s also an important downside: if you run two TensorFlow processes at once, then you’re going to have a bad time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re running on Colab you don’t need to worry about this, but if you’re running locally this is definitely something you should be careful about. In particular, be aware that closing a notebook tab does not necessarily shut that notebook down! You may need to select running notebooks (the ones with a green icon) and manually shut them down in the directory listing. Any running notebook that was using TensorFlow could still be holding on to a bunch of your GPU memory, and that means any new notebook you start may encounter some very odd issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you start getting errors about CUDA, BLAS, or cuBLAS in code that worked before, this is very often the culprit. You can use a command like nvidia-smi to check — when you shut down or restart your current notebook, is most of your memory free, or is it still in use?

Alternatively, this can also be caused by training issues like bad hyperparameter settings.\n",

It will also help you see if your initial learning rate is too high.\n",

    "Intense hyperparameter tuning is always emphasized as being the hardest part of machine learning, but it’s just the last step to help you gain a little bit on the metric. Very bad values for your hyperparameters, like using the default Adam learning rate of 1e-3 with a Transformer model, will make learning proceed very slowly or completely stall, of course, but most of the time “reasonable” hyperparameters, like a learning rate from 1e-5 to 5e-5, will work just fine to give you good results. So, don’t launch into a time-consuming and costly hyperparameter search until you have something that beats the baseline you have on your dataset.\n",
